# Copilot Instructions for this Flutter/Dart Repository

## Code Standards

- **Always validate code after changes:**
    - Run `flutter run` or another fast validation command to ensure the project compiles without
      errors before committing.
    - Fix any compile errors immediately.

- **Test-driven development:**
    - Always run `flutter test` before starting any task and regularly during development.
    - Fix or refactor any failing tests so all tests pass before submitting changes.

- **Keep code clean and formatted:**
    - Use `dart format .` frequently to enforce consistent code style.
    - Use `dart analyze` to keep the codebase clean and resolve warnings/errors.

- **Production code must remain functional:**
    - Do not modify production code unless absolutely necessary for the requested feature or fix.
    - Any modification should be justified in the commit message and, when substantial, documented.

- **BLoC architecture guidelines:**
    - Prefer the BLoC pattern for state and business logic management.
    - For each logical group of BLoCs, create a dedicated folder (e.g., `lib/blocs/auth/`,
      `lib/blocs/devotional/`).
    - Keep business logic out of UI components; organize by feature and responsibility.

## Development Workflow

- Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
- Validate compilation: `flutter run`
- Run tests: `flutter test`
- Format code: `dart format .`
- Analyze code: `dart analyze`

## ⚠️ Terminal Contingency (CRITICAL)

The JetBrains AI terminal **silently drops output** when `isBackground=false`.

**Always use this pattern for every command:**

```
Step 1 → run_in_terminal(cmd, isBackground=TRUE)
Step 2 → get_terminal_output(id)
```

For analysis/tests, use the project scripts with this pattern:

```bash
# Analyze:
bash errors.sh 2>&1; echo EXIT=$?

# Test ONE file (never run full suite — reporter crashes):
bash tests.sh test/unit/providers/devocional_provider_test.dart 2>&1; echo EXIT=$?
```

See `docs/COPILOT_WORKSPACE_IDENTITY.md` for full details.

## Guidelines

1. Keep the existing project structure and organization.
2. Write unit tests for any new functionality or bugfix.
3. Document public APIs and complex logic.
4. Update documentation in `docs/` or README.md if changes impact usage or structure.
